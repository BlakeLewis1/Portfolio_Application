# Portfolio App

*This is a Repository that will be used to store files related to the eventual development of a portfolio site application. Languages used are Python, Bash, HTML, CSS ~ Eventually this Development will be made Private!*


This is to become a dynamic website capable of hosting multiple portfolio entries. Having the ability to manipulate data and options to create custom content. The site should be capable of hosting both word and image content within a database and hosted on a server with minimal cost.

The site will require a login page, this will however not be accessable via the main site an needs to be searched for via its extention for added security. When logged in I should have options to add and manipulate the current data.

This Data but have an option to make it Active or inactive from the site. The reason for this is to only show finished Documentation and/or finished projects.

Using "Tags" I want to seperate the data into catagories in a custom menu. the idea is that I get to persionalise my collections aswell as having the menu change dynamicly to the entries I make. All features used to extend my site will be developed to with Automation in mind. The least amount of manipulation is what i expect to achive when developing my project.

As I plan not to spen much on this project ill be building it in stages. Working on the data required to achin=ve the outcome and layout i expect to achive. This will be documented within a Trello and tables within my project flushed out in Entity Relationship Diagrams. All content must be backed up using git and hard versions of the site stored and versions within Docker Hub. 

> Note: This project is being developed by me alone and is to be used for my persional portfolio. All stages of the development will be used as if being made for a larger scale production as to demonstrate/maintain good practice.
